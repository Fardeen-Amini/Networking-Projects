# Networking Projects

This repository includes practical networking labs and configurations built using tools like Cisco Packet Tracer and GNS3. Projects are grouped by routing and switching categories, demonstrating concepts like:

- Static, Routing, RIP, and OSPF
- VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing
- Port Security and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

These labs are intended to simulate real-world networking scenarios to build skills for roles like Network Administrator, System Administrator, or Technical Support Engineer.
